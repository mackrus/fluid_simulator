# Fluid Simulator

This project is a fluid dynamics simulator that visualizes the behavior of fluids with various properties and forces applied to them. It is designed to be an educational tool for understanding fluid mechanics and a foundation for further development in physics simulations.

## Features

- Real-time fluid dynamics simulation
- Interactive environment with adjustable parameters
- Visualization of fluid flow and pressure fields

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript ES6 modules.

### Installation

    1. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone <https://github.com/mackrus/fluid_simulator.git>
    ```

    2. Navigate to the project directory

    ```sh
    cd fluid_simulator
    ```

    3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser

## Usage

Interact with the simulation through the provided user interface to adjust parameters such as viscosity, density, and external forces. The changes will be reflected in real-time within the simulation.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
