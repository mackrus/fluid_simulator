# Fluid Simulator

This project is a fluid dynamics simulator that visualizes the behavior of a wind tunnel. It is designed to be an educational tool for understanding fluid mechanics and a foundation for further development in physics simulations.

## Features

- Real-time fluid dynamics simulation
- Visualization of fluid flow

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

To use the simulator in your browser, click [here] (<https://mackrus.github.io/fluid_simulator/>).

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript ES6 modules.

### Installation

    1. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone <https://github.com/mackrus/fluid_simulator.git>
    ```

    2. Navigate to the project directory

    ```sh
    cd fluid_simulator
    ```

    3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser

## Usage

Interact with the simulation through the provided user interface to adjust parameters such as viscosity, density, and external forces. The changes will be reflected in real-time within the simulation.
